# Menu Scene

The menu scene currently has a "play game" button (takes player to the game scene), a "tutorial" button (not programmed yet, will eventually take players to a tutorial scene), a "settings" button and a "quit" button.

**tasks for menu scene**
- implement the "settings"
- revise the visual design of the main menu
- implement "tutorial button"


# Game Scene

Currently, the game scene has a deck of cards, point counters for both the player and enemy, "turn" buttons for both the player and enemy (enemy turn button is temporary and will later be automated), and a "play area" with a specific section for the player's current hand. Currently there are three types of cards:
- Test Asset
- Test Attack
- Test Defense

When the game begins, a player hand of 4 cards is automatically generated.

**known issues for game scene**
- initially generated player's hand does not seem to draw cards from the deck
- drag and drop mostly works, but allows player to "drop" cards where they shouldn't
