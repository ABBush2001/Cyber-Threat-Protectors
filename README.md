# Menu Scene

The menu scene currently has a "play game" button (takes player to the game scene), a "tutorial" button (not programmed yet, will eventually take players to a tutorial scene) and a "quit" button.

**tasks for menu scene**
- create a "settings" button and implement its appropriate functions
- revise the visual design of the main menu


# Game Scene

Currently, the game scene has a deck of cards, point counters for both the player and enemy, "turn" buttons for both the player and enemy (enemy turn button is temporary and will later be automated), and a "play area" with a specific section for the player's current hand. Currently there are three types of cards:
- Test Asset
- Test Attack
- Test Defense

When the game begins, a player hand of 4 cards is automatically generated.

**known issues for game scene**
- initially generated player's hand does not seem to draw cards from the deck
- need to determine how to implement drag and drop
